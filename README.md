# Anemia Sense – Leveraging Machine Learning for Precise Anemia Recognitions

Anemia Sense is a machine learning–based system designed to detect anemia using key medical parameters. The goal of this project is to help in early identification and support timely medical analysis using data-driven predictions.

## Project Overview

The model takes user inputs such as hemoglobin level, MCV, MCH, RBC count, and other clinical parameters and predicts whether the person is anemic or not. A Streamlit-based UI makes the system easy to use and visually clean.

## Features

- Simple Streamlit user interface
- Fast anemia prediction based on ML model
- Input validation for safe predictions
- Real-time prediction output
- Easy to run and deploy
